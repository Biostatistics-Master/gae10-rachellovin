## Scenario 1: Ecology, Behavior, and Coraciiformes Color

Coraciiform species (@fig-Kingfishers) have diverse plumage coloration including pigmentary and structural colors, live in a range of different environments, show variable levels of territoriality, variability in the presence or absence of cooperative breeding (but with near uniform social monogamy), and different types of hunting strategy. @babarovicEffectsEcologyBehavior2023 measured plumage coloration from digital images of museum specimens and quantified several proxies for factors that could play a key role in the evolution of coloration including sex, body size, hunting strategy, habitat light environment, territoriality, and social mating system. They were interested in exploring how different possible biotic and abiotic factors may have affected the evolution of Coraciiform coloration.

### Methods:

The researchers used study skins of 117 species of Coraciiformes (families Meropidae, Brachypteraciidae, Coraciidae, Todidae, Momotidae, Alcedinidae) from the bird collections of the Natural History Museum at Tring, UK. Calibrated digital images of study skins were taken using methods described in @cooneySexualSelectionPredicts2019 and were used to quantify both chromatic (hue and saturation) and achromatic (brightness) components of color for each of several body regions (patches). The selected body regions were: crown, nape, mantle, rump, tail, wing coverts, wing primaries and secondaries, throat, breast, belly, and tail underside. They then used mapping functions to convert red-green-blue values for each patch on each specimen into values appropriate for the visual abilities of this order. Then they calculated average patch values (separately for each sex) as a species-level measure for each body patch. They then used principle components analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the color data across body patches and species and found that the first principle component accounted for \>80% of the variation in color [@babarovicEffectsEcologyBehavior2023]. @babarovicEffectsEcologyBehavior2023 then collated information on: body size; light-level associated habitat preference; hunting strategies; territoriality; and cooperative breeding from available literature.

#### Statistical Methods:

For our statistical methods I used a principal components analysis to examine patterns in the data provided by @babarovicEffectsEcologyBehavior2023. I ran a principal components analysis on the data using the PCA function from the FactoMineR package [@FactoMineR-3]. I used functions from the factoextra package to visualize the PCA and clean it up [@factoextra-2]. I ran a PCA on individuals, and also one on variables. I ran the PCA on four different groups of birds based on parental care, hunting strategy, light environment, and territoriality. The PCA of hunting strategy is included, as it showed the most separation between individuals.

```{r}
#| label: Scenario1DataImport

color <- read_csv("colors.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

# I have provided the PCA1 scores for the patches (columns 2-12) as an index of
# the complex color data for each species (rows) as well as the body size (a
# quantitative supplementary variable, column 13) and ecological behavioral
# classifications (qualitative supplemental variables, columns 14-17) in
# colors.csv. Please explore any grouping and/or patterning among the species
# and their ecological/behavioral traits.

```

#### Results:

In terms of variables, the PCA shows that areas on the dorsal side of the animal (tail, rump, nape, wing) are more closely correlated with principal component 1 and ventral side of the animal (belly, breast, throat, underside of tail) are more closely correlated with principal component 2 (@fig-colorbiplot). Positive positioning on PC1 was associated with the back side of the bird being more blue, while positive positioning along PC2 was associated with red/green coloration on the underside of the bird. For the PCA of individuals based on hunting strategy, the centroids for each of the four groups are in different quadrants. Aerial catchers are clustered on the left side of the graph, with the centroid located in the upper left quadrant. This indicates that aerial catchers are less blue on their backsides and more red and green on their fronts. Ground catchers show slight clustering on the right side of the graph with a centroid in the upper left quadrant. This indicates that they are more likely to be blue on their backs and red or green on their fronts. The centroid for the ground dwellers is in the lower left quadrant, indicating that they are less likely to be blue on their backs or red and green on their fronts. Finally, the centroid for water divers is in the lower right quadrant, meaning that they are more likely to be blue on their backs and less likely to be red or green on their fronts (@fig-colorbiplot).

## Scenario 2: Deer and Forest Plant Communities

White-tailed deer (*Odocoileus virginianus*) are often considered to be keystone species in forest communities. @sabo2017 conducted surveys of the vegetation and environmental conditions of deer exclusion plots and adjacent plots outside the exclusion areas as part of a larger study to examine the indirect effects of their presence on the plant assemblages.

### Methods:

In Summer 2011, the researchers visited 17 deer exclosures in upland forests of northern Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula (UP) that were constructed for various previous studies between 1991 and 2002. In each stand, they sampled vegetation and measured key environmental variables inside the fences and in paired ‘deer-access’ plots outside the fences. The latter were in close proximity to the exclosures (always within 100 m), and were placed in locations with similar management histories and overstory structure and composition. Within each exclosure and control area, multiple quadrats were sampled and they recorded the incidence of all herbaceous, shrub, and tree seedling species.

#### Statistical Methods:

I ran an NMDS on the data from [@sabo2017] using the metaMDS function from the vegan package [@vegan]. I next ran a PERMANOVA using the adonis2 function from the vegan package and created a table using the kbl function from the kableExtra package [@vegan-3; @kableExtra-2].

```{r}
#| label: Scenario2DataImport

# I have provided data representing the proportion of quadrats each species
# (columns) was found in as a an index of abundance within each deer exclosure
# (rows) in Sabo_etal_data.csv.

# Use NMDS to explore the differences in plant community inside and outside the
# deer exclosures, then test for differences in the plant communities between
# the deer exclosures and the adjacent forests.

deer <- read_csv("Sabo_etal_data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```

#### Results:

Based on the results of the PERMANOVA, the p value for treatment is far above our significance threshold of .05 (@tbl-deerPERMANOVA). This means that we have failed to reject our null hypothesis of there being no significant difference in the plant communities found in deer-exclusion and deer-inclusion areas. Statistically, the plant communities in these two areas are the same.

#| label: deernMDS

deermds <- metaMDS(
  deer[,-c(1:2)],
  k = 4

#| label: tbl-deerPERMANOVA
#| tbl-cap: "PERMANOVA to test for a difference in plant assemblages between deer exclusion areas and adjacent areas"

deerPERMANOVA <- adonis2(
  deer[,-c(1,2)] ~ Treatment,
  data = deer,
  by = "margin",
  permutations = 10001
)

kbl(
  deerPERMANOVA,
  format = "markdown",
  degits = c(0,3,3,3,3),
  col.names = c(
    "df",
    "SS",
    "$R^2$",
    "F",
    "P"
